Meet Ridin' Rudy.  I regularly run into this neighborhood staple when I walk down 24th street to Madison Square Park.  Every time I see him on his pink bike he has a new elaborate ensemble in his signature color, <span class="standout">decked out</span> from head to toe.  Great things about Rudy:  he is bold, memorable, and lives to make a statement.  

When designing a home I think it is generally a good idea to leave the "pink threw up all over my room" look for the six-year-old girls; however, I do think it is essential to be bold in some of your choices.   I look at this chair and I think...whoever owns that is confident and <span class="standout">has some personality!</span>  It is so exciting to see something a little unexpected.  Be bold. Be memorable.
