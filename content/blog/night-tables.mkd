Turtlenecks are the worst.  They are unflattering and uncomfortable&mdash;so are spaces that are cluttered and crammed with furniture&mdash;there is no room to breathe.  New Yorkers are especially aware of how valuable living space is:  <span class="standout">utilizing every inch of space</span>, finding functional furniture that will not only make it up seven flights of stairs but will fit in their space-challenged apartments.  It's easy to squeeze out all the room to breathe, just like squeezing your head through a suffocating turtleneck.  

These hanging night tables are brilliant!  You have the function of a bedside table without a bulky piece of furniture taking up your precious floor space.  And unlike wearing a turtleneck...it's a lot more sexy.
