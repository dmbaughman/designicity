Fashion and interior design have some parallels.  That said, if you wear your Uggs with a Juicy suit (and you probably have one in every color) this post is most likely not your style.  <span class="standout">I love some edge.</span>  If my fashion sense were a piece of furniture...this would be it.  Black...love.  Gold...love.  Hardware...love.  This console is so sleek and simple and the details are subtle but strong.
