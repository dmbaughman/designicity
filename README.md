# Designicity

This site is for an interior design blog using the [Wok][wok] static website generator created by [Mike Cooper][mikesite]

## Basic Idea

The homepage has a gallery view of all blog posts, so it doesn't look like a traditional blog--it mainly just shows nice pictures from each blog post.

Each individual blog entry has its own page, which looks more or less like a normal blog entry, with the usual date, title, tags, etc.

The "blogroll" view shows all the entries, but in more of a traditional view.
